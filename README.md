this repo stores my class assignements in FDU. I only keep these two projects, because they are the only two projects that are difficult.

JOS is a micro kernel operating system. I implemnt all functionality: memory management, process, driver, and a mini web server.

Tiger is the language in Modern Compiler Implementation in ML , I implement all functionality: lex, grammar, abstract syntax tree, compile to c.
